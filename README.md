# INTRODUCTION
The Aim was to create a Calculator using the languages; HTML+CSS+JS

## Uses of the Languages
- HTML was used to create the calculator's structure, including buttons and input fields.
- CSS was used to style the calculator's layout and theme, including background color, button style, and font.
- JavaScript was used to implement the calculator's arithmetic operations and theme change functionality.

**Theme Change Functionality is still WIP**
